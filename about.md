# ℹ️ About

A hands-on training workshop on Post-GWAS Analysis Using SNP-Seek and RicePilaf. This in-depth session is designed for researchers looking to advance their skills in candidate gene analyses.

## Short Description:

* SNP-Seek version 3 is an online web application that provides a user-friendly, comprehensive database for the genetic variations, phenotypes, and variety information of the 3500 rice genomes accessions.

* RicePilaf is a web-based post-GWAS/QTL application that integrates pangenomic, coexpression, regulatory, epigenomic, ontology, pathway, and text-mining information. It aims to provide functional insights into rice QTLs and GWAS regions identified from QTL and GWAS mapping studies.

## What You'll Learn:

* Navigate and utilize the SNP-Seek version 3 database

* Perform post-GWAS analysis workflows using RicePilaf

* Best practices for downstream functional analysis

## What to Bring: 

* Please bring your laptop. All datasets will be provided.
